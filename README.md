Code -> download zip -> Extract

Move the **Pastloot** folder, that is in the same folder as this README, to your addons directory.


**Warnings** 

An empty rule will match and do whatever the setting is.  EG if you have an empty vendor rule as your first rule, it will vendor everything a vendor price.  I intend to change this behavior.

Full usable but not yet ready for release

```ini
[Pre-release]
review -> accept button
macro to add/remove to default keep/vendor/delete rules
implement destroy => on acquire, at bagspace threshold => report to default output

[Low Priority]

implement "test mode"
Module -> tsm prices
Module -> tsm vs vendor
```
